# Raspberry Pi Ball Tracking Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the 4 motors use for my robot making sure they were wired and coded correctly through raspberry pi. First I set up the raspberry OS to the raspberry pi in order to run python. After this, I wired the motor driver to the raspberry making sure the wires were connected to the correct pins. Which is important when coding the movement of the motors. After this, I wired the motor driver to the 4 motors and 4 pack battery holder as a power source for the motor driver. After setting up the wiring I used python in pi to coded the  motors to be able to go forward all at the same time.
